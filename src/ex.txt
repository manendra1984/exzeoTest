You have a GroceryApp class, which receives a list of products, 
each one with name and votes. The app should render an unordered list,
 with a list item for each product. Products can be upvoted or downvoted.

 

By appropriately using React state and props, implement the upvote/downvote logic.
 Keep the state in the topmost component, while the Product component should accept props.

 

Consider that there is a node service which serves you endpoint for list of products 
(GET /products) and update votes (POST /upvote, POST /downvote).

 

Note: Code should be neat and clean

      There should be proper setup so that anybody can run the application by single line command

      There should some sample for test cases
